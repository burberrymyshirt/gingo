# gingo

This project attempts to wrap around [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) and [Gorm](https://github.com/go-gorm/gorm), to make them play nice together.

It started with me being unsatisfied with the error messages provided by the validation in Gin, but my goal is to make database validation, kind of like [Laravel](https://github.com/laravel/laravel) does it, but we'll see where it goes.

I am still fairly new to the world of Go, so any suggestions or improvements are more than welcome.
